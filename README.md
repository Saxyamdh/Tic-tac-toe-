# Tic-tac-toe-
The following repository contains files for the tic tac toe game built using vanilla js.
The repository contains three files. Index.html, index.css(used for stuling the web page and myapp.js). The project is simply done using vanilla js.
This is a multiplayer game where the in-play player can just click in one of the players to play the game.
